# Ethereum Trustless Fund
A trust fund built in Solidity. We use the blockchain to allow users to deposit funds into an account for their beneficiaries to withdraw at a later date.

Includes the smart contract code as well as a front end to interface with the contract.

Why use a smart contract for a trust fund? Well, if you use a smart contract you know that the money will be there forever. You don't have to trust a third party to know it will stay there. Just keep track of the smart contract address that you deposited the money to and even if the website that allowed you to deposit the money goes down (which it could) the smart contract will still hold your money and you'll be able to withdraw that money with either a different UI or programatically if you'd like.

The main branch is empty but there are branches off this branch for some of the tutorial steps.
