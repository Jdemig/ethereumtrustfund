# Ethereum Trustless Fund
A trust fund built in Solidity. We use the blockchain to allow users to deposit funds into an account for their beneficiaries to withdraw at a later date.

Includes the smart contract code as well as a front end to interface with the contract.

The main branch is empty but there are branches off this branch for some of the tutorial steps.
